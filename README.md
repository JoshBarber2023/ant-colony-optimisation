# Ant Colony Optimisation Visualisation üêú

This project demonstrates the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithm applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Cities are randomly placed on a 2D plane, and multiple ants explore possible routes based on pheromone trails and distance heuristics. Over several iterations, the algorithm converges on an optimal or near-optimal path. The final result is visualised and saved as an animated GIF (`aco_animation.gif`) showing the best path found.  

**Disclaimer:** Parts of this code and documentation were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT to accelerate development and improve clarity. AI assistance was used to help implement standard algorithms, handle plotting and animation, and structure explanations effectively.
